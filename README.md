🌍 Iraq Primary School Enrollment Analysis (1970–2007)

📌 Overview  
This project explores Iraq’s **primary school gross enrollment ratio** between 1970–2007.  
It uses **Python (Pandas/Matplotlib)** and **Jupyter Notebook** to analyze historical enrollment trends and resilience before and after major disruptions.

The goal is to deliver **clear, portfolio-ready insights** into Iraq’s education trends over nearly four decades.
