# 📊 Iraq Primary School Enrollment (1970–2023)

This project explores Iraq’s primary school gross enrollment ratio from 1971–2023, combining SQL, Python (Pandas/Matplotlib), and Jupyter Notebook into a structured analysis.

It delivers **14 insights across two groups**:

- **Core 9 Questions** → trend, decade averages, YoY changes, etc.  
- **5 Bonus Insights** → pre/post 1990, volatility, resilience, etc.

All results are reproducible, visualized, and documented in both **HTML** and **PDF** formats.

## 🔎 Core 9 Insights (with Visuals)

1. **Overall Trend** → Iraq enrollment improved until early 1990s, then dropped, later recovered.  
2. **Trend with Regression** → Long-run slope is positive.  
3. **Trend with Mean Line** → Mean ≈ 93.3%.  
4. **Highest vs Lowest** → Peak: 1991 (111.2%); Lowest: 1971 (70.0%).  
5. **Decade Averages** → 1980s highest; 1970s lowest.  
6. **Year-over-Year Changes** → Biggest rise: 1979; Biggest drop: 1992.  
7. **Overall Average (Card)** → 93.26%.  
8. **Distribution (Mean vs Median)** → Median > Mean → skew from 1990s drop.  
9. **Recovery (1992–1999)** → Enrollment recovered to 1992 levels by 1999.
