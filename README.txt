ðŸ“Š Iraq Primary School Enrollment (1970â€“2023)

This project analyzes Iraqâ€™s primary school gross enrollment ratio from 1971â€“2023, using SQL, Python (Pandas/Matplotlib), and Jupyter Notebook.

It delivers 14 insights across two groups:

Core 9 Questions (trend, decade averages, YoY changes, etc.)

5 Bonus Insights (pre/post 1990, volatility, resilience, etc.)

All results are reproducible, visualized, and documented in both HTML and PDF formats.
